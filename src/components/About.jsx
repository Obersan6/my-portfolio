            <br /> 
            Iâ€™m a <span className="font-bold text-[#077488]">full-stack software developer</span> with a background in psychology, especially in areas like cognitive science, neuroscience, and technology. I enjoy building educational tools and meaningful productsâ€”mostly in fields like education, research, health, and well-being, but Iâ€™m open to any mission-driven project that sparks curiosity and impact.
            <br />

            <br></br>
          
            Iâ€™m currently expanding <span className="font-bold text-[#077488]">PsychoDiagnose</span>, an interactive diagnostic tool built to help psychology students apply the <span className="font-bold text-[#077488]">DSM-5-TR</span> in clinical settings. Iâ€™m also co-developing an <strong><em>AI-powered</em></strong>  application that enables users to engage directly with commercial products in a more personalized way. Weâ€™re designing it as a practical, user-centered solution with plans to bring it to marketâ€”and itâ€™s already starting to attract interest. I love creating thoughtful, real-world applications, and Iâ€™m always excited to take on new challenges.
